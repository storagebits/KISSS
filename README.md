## About this project
K.I.S.S.S. Keep It Simple Slide Scanner is an other DIY slide scanner project. Here you'll find informations about . It is provided "as is". You'll need to adapt it to your own installation.

It uses a simple projector lens trick which allows a DSLR to capture a slide by photographing it directly from the projector instead from the projected picture. 

IMAGE PROJECTOR 

My dad was doing a lot (LOT) of photographies on slides from the early 1960's up to early 1990's. Since many years

IMAGE STOCK 

My goal was to capture those 10'000 slides. First to keep those memories in a safe place and then to have an easy way to watch them.
